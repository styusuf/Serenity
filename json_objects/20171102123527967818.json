Generously white rice flour top of dough. Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Slide parchment and dough onto a rimmed baking sheet.                                                                                                                            7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Pile filling into center of crust, leaving a 3-inch border around filling. Fold dough border over apple filling; dough will pleat as you do this. The dough will not cover the filling completely; the center remains uncovered. (You can always slide your hand under the parchment paper and lift it to help you fold the dough onto the apples.) Generously sprinkle granulated sugar on edge of crust.                                                                                                                            8                                                                            Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake for an additional 20 minutes or until crust is golden brown and filling bubbles.                                                                                                                            9                                                                            Remove pan from oven.
