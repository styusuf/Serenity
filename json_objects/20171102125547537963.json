Try pairing with Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 20 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428827,"title":"Waterbrook Reserve Chardonnay","description":"Beautiful and golden in color, this chardonnay has persistent ripe pear and lychee flavors that are complemented by a subtle, sweet toasty oak.

Add salt & pepper to taste.  Add the cooked & rinsed udon noodles to the bowl with the vegetables and mix well.  Pour the dressing onto the noodles & veggies and mix using two forks until the dressing is disbursed throughout.  Garnish with additional sesame seeds.  Serve immediately, or refrigerate, covered, for 30 minutes, or up to one day.Cassie’s Notes:To make carrot ribbons: use a vegetable peeler to remove the outer skin of the carrot.  Lay the carrot flat on a cutting board and run the vegetable peeler along the full length of the carrot, creating thin ribbons.  Cut wide ribbons in half.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Cook the udon noodles according to package directions.  When finished, rinse with cold water.
