Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. White meat is typically paired with white wine as to not overpower the flavor of the meat, so chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are safe choices. Chicken prepared with a tomato sauce or certainly a red wine sauce can and should be served with a red like a pinot noir. The NV Mindbender Chardonnay with a 4.4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428583,"title":"NV Mindbender Chardonnay","description":"Lightly Oaked, the Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal.

The Mindbender Chardonnay is here to make you see Chardonnay in a new and innovative way. The Mindbender Chardonnay is a sophisticated style of Chardonnay, that is full of the best elements of this classic grape varietal. Visually it is golden straw in color.

The well-rounded flavors carry the butterscotch throughout lending a smooth, creamy aspect while the citrus flavors bring freshness and brightness to the body. The good percentage of oak aging brings a lovely vanilla note. The finish is rounded out with a depth of ripe fruit flavors such as apricots, melons and peaches with a spritz of lime.","price":"$12.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/428583-312x231.jpg","link":"https://www.amazon.com/Mindbender-California-Chardonnay-White-Wine/dp/B00GB87SJQ"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                In a large saucepan, saute onion and celery in butter until tender.
