great choices for Fish. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Santa Cristina by Antinori Pinot Grigio. It has 4.1 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":444296,"title":"Santa Cristina by Antinori Pinot Grigio","description":"The 2012 wine is deep straw-yellow in color.
