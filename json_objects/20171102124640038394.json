Sweet bubbly Prosecco doesn't overwhelm simple sugar or shortbread cookies, a sweet cream sherry complements spiced cookies, and madeira's nutty notes match cookies with nuts perfectly. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":428475,"title":"NV Solera Cream Sherry","description":"The Solera Cream Sherry has a brilliant amber and deep copper hue.

Line an 8 inch square metal baking pan with foil and spray the foil with cooking spray.Cream the butter with the brown and granulated sugar. Beat in the vanilla and egg and beat just until the egg is mixed, then beat in the salt and baking soda. By hand, stir in the flour until it is incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chips. Press dough into the bottom of the pan as evenly as possible. Press 9 whole Oreos directly into the dough.Wash out the mixing bowl. Add the cocoa powder and oil and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the eggs, sugar, vanilla and salt until smooth; stir in the flour. Spread this batter over the Oreos. Bake on the center rack at 350 for 38 to 40 minutes or until brownies appear set and edges are puffed up. Unfortunately, the toothpick test doesn’t really work here. Cool on a wire rack. When cool, chill the brownies for about 2 or 3 hours. Lift from pan and cut into 16 squares.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
