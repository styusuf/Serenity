                               Place eggplant in a colander over a plate; sprinkle with salt and toss. Let stand for 30 minutes.                                                                                             Meanwhile, place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook for 10-15 minutes or until tender. Drain. Mash potatoes with sour cream and butter; set aside.                                                                                            Rinse eggplant and drain well.
